      Even though he had just performed for an audience of millions, Tesfaye was
      still, to many of them, a total stranger. When he began releasing music in
      2010 - murky DalÃ­-esque R.&B., sung in an astrally sweet voice, vivid with
      details of life at the sexual and pharmacological extremes - Tesfaye chose
      to be a cipher.

  Music really does make the world go round and it would be a pretty grey place
  without it. I never shy away from trying new things and everyone should give
  new music genres a go, don't always stick to the tried and tested.
